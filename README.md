# Improve your Python Recall Fluency

><u>**Description:**</u> I created this repository to help Python programmers to improve their recall fluency in the world of vibe coding, which eventually degenerates the muscle memory one has in Python programming.  
There are "drills and "exercises" folders that store topics in Python as individual *.py files. The convention I use is:
```python
<topic name>_drills.py
<topic_name>_exercises.py
```
A ***xxx_drills.py*** file is like the answer sheet for the coresponding ***xxx_exercises.py*** file. You are meant to solve the questions in each ***xxx_exercises.py*** file without peeking at the answers in the ***xxx_drills.py*** to help you improve your recall fluency over time. While working on the exercises, you simply need to write the implementation by replacing the **#TODO** line. *DO NOT CHANGE THE DOCSTRING* in any of the functions unless you know what you are doing! As an option, you can also modify the tests provided in the docstring section of each function if you would like to try different tests for the functions you implement. You need to do these exercises regularly (ideally 10-15 minutes each day) to see noticeable progress in 2-3 weeks' time. After you attempt each question without peeking and get stuck, you can peek at the answer to complete your work.  
After you complete answering all the questions on a topic (say ***fileio_exercises.py***), you can check the accuracy using python's doctest as follows:
```python
python -m doctest -v exercises/fileio_exercises.py
```
You can perform this quick test and verification method for any of the exercises in this repository. How cool is that? 


I will continue adding new drills and exercises moving forward. If you find this useful/helpful, please don't forget to indicate your fondness with a start on my repository.  

Thank you & enjoy!
